\begin{abstract}
    Building \ac{ML} models requires significant domain knowledge, and training such models is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Determined AI is a deep learning training platform that simplifies and automates the model building process and accelerates the training process by seamlessly applying distributed training with multiple \acp{GPU}. In this project, we propose Spur to optimize the resource allocation (\acs{GPU} and \acs{CPU}) for different distributed training strategies (e.g., AllReduce and ParameterServer) to further accelerate the training performance and improve resource efficiency.
